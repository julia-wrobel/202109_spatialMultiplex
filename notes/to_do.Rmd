## To do

* Learn about `spatialExperiment` 
  * Go through [this textbook](https://lmweber.org/OSTA-book/spatialexperiment.html)
  * Chapter 1
  * Chapter 2
  * Chapter 3
  * Chapter 4
  * Chapter 5
  * Chapter 6
  * Chapter 7
  * Chapter 8
  * Read [bioarxiv paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.428431v2)
  * Check out workshops from last bioconductor conference [here](https://lmweber.org/OSTAWorkshopBioc2021/), [here](https://drighelli.github.io/SpatialExperiment_Bioc2021/index.html)
  
* Make Vectra compatible with `spatialExperiment`
  * Check out `read10xVisium()` function, which creates a SpatialExperiment object from the raw input files expected from the 10x Genomics processing software ([link](https://github.com/drighelli/SpatialExperiment/blob/master/R/read10xVisium.R))
  * Write function for tabular data
  * Determine slot/structure for adding clinical data
  * Write function for image data
    * Each pixel is a row?
    * If segmentation is defined, write function for extracting cells and putting into table format
  
* Explore `ExperimentData` packages on Bioconductor
  * Check out [ST example data](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/STexampleData.html)
  * Check out [JP's](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/data/experiment/html/ARRmData.html)
  * Check out [Sean Davis's](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/data/experiment/html/ChimpHumanBrainData.html)
  * Check out [Stephanie's Visium package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/data/experiment/html/TENxPBMCData.html)
  * Think about which dataset you would want to turn into a package
  * Go through [guidelines](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/AnnotationHub/inst/doc/CreateAHubPackage.html) on how to create ExperimentHub package

* Put Simon's mIF data in `data` folder
  * Do brief exploratory analysis
  * Add this data to datasets document
  * Work towards making this compatible with Spatial Experiment


* Spatial proteomics
  * Look for existing packages 
  * http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pRoloc.html

## Recently completed


## Ongoing questions

* Types of Bioconductor packages include: analysis software packages, annotation packages, data packages, workflow packages, online books
  * What are each of these?
  * Is `spatialExperiment` a workflow package?
* When creating a data package, would it be best to have data from one platform (just Vectra) or from multiple platforms?
* What software do you use to make the pretty figures?


## About spatial transcriptomics

* What is a molecule?
* From a data structure perspective, what are the differences between spatial transcriptomics and multiplex single cell imaging?
  * ST doesn't have single cell masks, right?
  * ST is wayyy more multiplex in the sense that there are hundreds if not thousands of genes
  * ST has counts and MI has continuous marker intensities
    * Are there "intensities" at all for ST?
