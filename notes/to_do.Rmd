## To do


### MI to ST conversion

* Make Vectra compatible with `spatialExperiment`
  * Determine slot/structure for adding clinical data
  * Determine what goes in `rowData` slot. Potentially create a lookup table for types of popular markers and :
    * whether they are surface/nucleour/phenotypic/membrane
    * what types of cells they tend to mark
  * Write function for image data
    * Each pixel is a row?
    * If segmentation is defined, write function for extracting cells and putting into table format
    
* Data 
  * Vectra 3 lung cancer data
  * Vectra Polaris ovarian cancer data
 
    
### Data package   

* Explore `ExperimentData` packages on Bioconductor
  * Check out [ST example data](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/STexampleData.html)
  * Check out [JP's](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/data/experiment/html/ARRmData.html)
  * Check out [Sean Davis's](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/data/experiment/html/ChimpHumanBrainData.html)
  * Check out [Stephanie's Visium package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.13/data/experiment/html/TENxPBMCData.html)
  * Think about which dataset you would want to turn into a package
  * Go through [guidelines](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/AnnotationHub/inst/doc/CreateAHubPackage.html) on how to create ExperimentHub package

### About spatial transcriptomics

* Can `VistoSeg` be used to count/summarize the pixels in a cell?
* What is a molecule?
* How many genes are there typically in an ST experiment?
* From a data structure perspective, what are the differences between spatial transcriptomics and multiplex single cell imaging?
  * ST doesn't have single cell masks, right?
  * ST is wayyy more multiplex in the sense that there are hundreds if not thousands of genes
  * ST has counts and MI has continuous marker intensities
    * Are there "intensities" at all for ST?


### Angie questions

* What is the file structure for typical Vectra data after Inform processing? 
* How challenging is it to get the .tiff images?
* How are file names / ids set up for the Vectra instrument?
* What image preprocessing occurs before Inform?
* Data dictionary somewhere?
  * What is the "Confidence" column for Vectra data?
  * What are the TMA Sector/Row/Column/Field variables?
  * Are column names consistent for each analysis?
