## Overview 

This document provides info on how to convert Vectra data into a `spatialExperiment` object.

* Should have conversion functions for `tiff` files and `.txt` tabular data


## Correspondence between ST and MI

The `spatialExperiment` object has a particular structure. Here I explain the correspondence between `spatialExperiment` slots for typical ST data, and how we expect it to behave for MI data.


* `assays`: contains expression counts
  * columns: cells
  * rows: genes
  * In our case, columns are cells and rows are markers
    * assays contains mean/median expression values for each marker and each cell
* `rowData`: "feature metadata". What does this mean??
  * For us, this would contain information about markers... maybe marker type (phenotypic vs. functional)?
